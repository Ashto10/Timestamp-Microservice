Timestamp Microservice
==========================

A simple Timestamp Microservice that fulfills the following user stories:

1. "I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)."
2. "If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date."
3. "If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties."

More information about the challenge can be found [at FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/timestamp-microservice).
